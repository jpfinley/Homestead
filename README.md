# Homestead

Call me crazy, but I really dig [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig). It's a personalized homepage that brings the parts of the web you care about close at hand.

iGoogle is set to shut down November 2013. I wanted to continue that experience, so I built Homestead.

Like any homepage, it's designed to get you somewhere else. It's not much: just a single page with a few search bars and RSS feeds from sites I care about. The color scheme automatically switches from daytime to nighttime modes for easy reading.

##  Thanks

Thanks to the following open source projects I'm using to put this together:

- [jquery-rss](https://github.com/sdepold/jquery-rss)
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
